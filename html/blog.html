        <h1>Emotion, Stress, and Health </h1>

        <iframe allowfullscreen class="content" width="420" height="315"src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KbSRXP0wik"></iframe>
        <p class="videoDescription">
            The video Emotion, Stress, and Health was about how emotions affect health. 
            The three main reasons of how emotions can affect health is because of 
            lifestyle and behavioral factors, social factors, and biological factors. 
            Facial feedback hypothesis is when smiling can make your mood happier, even
             when not happy. Being depressed can make you unhealthy. Stress can also be 
             bad for your health and could be a cause of heart disease which is very common 
             in the U.S. Stress can increase blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol 
             which plays a huge factor to getting heart disease. The viewers should keep 
             in mind the way they handle their emotions such as being depressed, angry, or 
             stressed because it could lead to a negative health outcome. Emotions can be 
             changed which means everyone could try to be happier and healthier. I liked 
             this video because it was informative, and I have learned to always have a 
             positive mindset even when down. The video gives motivation to be happier 
             because it could affect out health in a good way.
